# ncnn-mtcnn
It is a mtcnn project based on ncnn 
### Note
I modified the mtcnn project of https://github.com/ElegantGod/ncnn.git；
1.I modified the nms algorithm which only needs two loops；
2.I remove the “struct orderScore”， which will save more memory；
3.I rebuild the project structure which is more clear；
