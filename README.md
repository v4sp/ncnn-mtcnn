# ncnn-mtcnn
It is a mtcnn project based on ncnn 
### Note
I modified the mtcnn project of https://github.com/ElegantGod/ncnn.git； Please use the ncnn of this repository.

1.I modified the nms algorithm which only needs two loops；   
2.I remove the “struct orderScore”， which will save more memory；    
3.I rebuild the project structure which is clear；
